## CPP Scaffold
This is my attempt at making a solid c++ base project. This basic project
will compile compile an object file for each cpp file in the src directory.
Then it will compile an executable named test and place it in bin. Lastly
it will generate a basic debian package which can be installed using
`sudo dpkg --install your_project`.
